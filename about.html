    <section id="summary">

            <p>Prior to pursuing a Computer Science Degree at Georgia Tech, I gained a curiosity for technology and
                programming from my initial exposure to online games as a child. Early online community games such as
                Millsberry, Runescape, and Fantage, to name a few, gaged my interest in learning on how programs, such
                as games, can bring communities together. And eventually, commencing innovations such as chat rooms and
                video calls demonstrated to me the potential that technology had. </p>
            <p>Though, contradictory to what this background suggests, I grew up in school as an art student. Having
                spent a majority of my time in school learning and practicing art, I was able to gain fundamental
                visual arts skills that I now apply to my work. I treat the front-end of my work as my canvas, always
                making sure that it is ready for a gallery-style presentation. Due to my enjoyment of technology and
                the arts, this eventually led me to self-venture into graphic design, photoshop, and video and audio
                editing where I could practice both of my passions. </p>
            <p>Realizing that my attachment to traditional art had dwindled, I decided to pursue a STEM field in high
                school and knew that computer science was my field of action because of its great calling for
                technological advancement and creativity. This decision led me to Georgia Tech where I have been
                attending since 2015. The rest of my story would be more fun to explain with pictures, therefore, I
                invite you to learn more about me through my hobbies, volunteer work, and involvement on campus, down
                below. Thank you. </p>
